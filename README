CS345 - Starter code for icalc

1. There are two Makefiles: one for using Flex/Bison and the other
for Lex/Yacc.  They are similar, but there are differences between the
two toolsets.  Choose the makefile you want to use and rename it to
Makefile or use the -f flag to the 'make' program as follows:

% make -f Makefile.bison

2. The file icalc.l contains a lexical specification for a very simple
integer calculator that operates like the Linux 'bc' calculator.

3. The file icalc.y contains a context free grammar specification in
YACC/Bison BNF for the calclulator.

4. The code should work on Windows if you have the Cygwin toolset
installed.  See http://www.cygwin.com/ and be sure to download the
developer tools including flex/bison and/or lex/yacc. To terminate the
input loop on Windows, use <ctrl-z> instead of <ctrl-d>.

5. If everything makes correctly, you should be left with an executable
file called 'icalc'.  A successful build and executable should look
like this:

skylane% make -f Makefile.bison
bison -dv -bicalc icalc.y
gcc -g -O   -c -o icalc.o icalc.c
flex -t icalc.l > scan.c
gcc -g -O   -c -o scan.o scan.c
gcc -g -O icalc.o scan.o -o icalc

skylane% icalc
